# Template Design
This website application uses HTML documents generated by templating engine,
which is an elegant way to design and compile HTML documents. Template files
can be found in [/templates] directory.

## Jinja2 Templates
Jinja2 is designer-friendly template engine that also enables use of
powerful filters and inline python code. For the syntax documentation please see 
Jinja2 (Template Designer Documentation)[https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/].
All the files with .html extension from the [/templates] directory will
be compiled using Jinja2 engine.

### Extra filters
On the top of the (builtin filters)[https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#builtin-filters]
there are also extra filters that can be customized or added in [/app/view.py]. These filters are:

- **basename**(path) - Return the base name of pathname path, see Python's 
  (os.path.basename)[https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#os.path.basename]
- **urlparse**(url) - Parses URL into 6 components and returns specified component of the result,
  see (urllib.parse.urlparse)[https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlparse]
- **timedelta**(datetime) - Returns humand readable format of time delta of given datetime object,
  for example "2 days and 3 hours ago". (currently under development and only english is supported)
- **timeformat**(datetime) - Converts datetime object to the specified format, see 
  (strftime())[https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior]


## Markdown Format
Content of Wiki and news articles is compiled from templates written in
the Markdown format. Wiki articles also support several extra syntax
specific for authoring wiki articles. For more information on Wiki articles
syntax see (the Wiki documentation)[https://github.com/velescore/veles-wiki/tree/master/docs].
Wiki articles are maintained in a separate repository, (veles-wiki)[https://github.com/velescore/veles-wiki].

News articles are also written in a Markdown format, with most of extensions
that are supported in wiki articles (apart of `figure` and `infobox`) and are
stored in [/templates/news].
