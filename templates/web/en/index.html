                                Veles Core is an open-source software project that aims to help people to retain their freedom of access to an information and their privacy on the Internet. Most of current solutions are either commercial centralized services 
                                or are based on volunteer networks which are prone to misuse and censorship. Too fill the gap and provide secure, trustless solution the project take an advantage of developments in distributed systems and blockchain technology,
                                to build economically self-supporting and eventually self-governing network, significantly more resistant to disruptions or or censorship.<br />
                                The network currently provides decentralized VPN and tunelling as well as decentralized recursive DNS. More services
                                will be gradually implemented over time, such as distributed Instant Messaging platform or trustless software
                                builds.

                                Over a decade of development in the blockchain technology has brought humanity significant advancements
                                in building distributed and decentralized systems. However, current Internet connection
                                anonymization services are mostly either commercial services or based on volunteer networks.
                                To fill the gap and provide secure, trustless solution we take an advantage of this technology to accomplish our goal by building economically self-supporting and eventually self-governing network, significantly more resistant to a disruption or to attempts to one's privacy violation by a third party such as an oppresive government.

Everyone can join this testing phase and use dVPN service for free, or run his own dVPN-enabled Veles Masternode. Benchmark data gathered from this public testing will help us to improve Veles dVPN for future launch to production.</p>

                            common issues with the current blockchain implementations.<br />
                            Independent multi-algorithmic PoW mining and other approaches against 51% attacks ensure secure and reliable
                            blockchain.<br /> 
                            Flexible block spacing, insta-mine protection, and dynamic capped block rewards based on hashrate 
                            ensure fairer mining opportunities on all the available algorithm and protects against low-cost opportunistic mining,
                            keeping costs of the mining more consistent and hence suporting more balanced price discovery.<br />
                            Dynamic hashrate-based block reward system is complemented by adaptive non-linear halving 
                            mechanism tied to current coin supply, ensuring the correct emmision rate to achieve
                            both low inflation and long-term sustainability.

                            <p class="my-6">Veles had a fair launch, no developer premine, no ICO or any type of fund-raising. First block on Veles chain was mined 6th Nov 2018 15:22:08, amount of this block was 50 000 VLS (2% of the Maximum Supply) which was used for coin-swap for early adopters which were part of the early test phase.<br />
                            Started with slow PoW phase with low block rewards and full PoW reward stage after block 50 000
                            by VCIP01 activationwhich was publicly announced in advance.<br />
                            To support development of the project in the initial stages, a development fund receives decreasing portion of the block reward, from 5% to 0% in 5 years (currently at <span class="tile-label-value"

                                                    >4.65 %</span>). We believe that should be enough to
                            grow this project to self-sustained phase. Besides the the dev fund we use open community funding model
                            based on donations to specific crowd-funding proposal.

                                Sane monetary policy plays an important role to ensure store of value of VLS cryptocurrency.<br />

                                mining would a hashrate drop on any algorithm. Adaptive non-linear halving system tied to
                                real emission rate compliments the dynamic block rewards and ensures ideal supply curve

                                Although well-calculated token emission rate and faird reward share play fundamental role in any successful

                                Unlike in traditional PoW systems, on Veles Network is not possible to mine low-cost coins by getting a full block reward with low hashrate on one of algorithms, due to dynamic block rewards based on hasrate.<br />
                                We have developed the concept non-linear, decreasing halving frequency to prevent unneccessary long inflation period during the PoW launch but preserves long steady supply rate.

                                This ensures correct supply curve and inflation rate with the store of value in mind.
                                Over 50% of the max. supply have been reached within first 2 years, and over 70% will be mined
                                within about next 5 years, the rest will take more than century to mine, helping long-term
                                sustainability.<br />
                                The share of the reward for the mined block it's also intended to better reflect the network's proggress.
                                Starting from the 90% PoW reward, 5% Masternode and 5% dev fund reward, progressing gradually to the 40% Pow and  
                                60% Masternode reward, and 0% dev reward within 5 - 7 years (by then the development will be funded through
                                decentralized organisation).
                                Although well-calculated token emission rate and faird reward share play fundamental role in any successful
                                economic model, the most important part for the long-term economic self-sufficiency of the project will play
                                the payments for extra services and resources provided by the Masternode operators. The Masternode
                                payments from block reward shares still ensure that all the basic services are

                                We've already implemented proposal submission and voting using masternodes, and within a next 5 - 7 years current the team will build and test neccessary means of decentralized governance for the ecosystem to
                                be governed by a self-governing and self-incentivized decentralized organization with it's own transparent funding, project management and development teams.

                                        Veles Core node encapsulates consensus and wallet functionality and takes an advantage of reliability,
                                        security and performance of the <b>C++</b> code, while many parts of the service layer 
                                        benefits from the flexbility, easy prototyping or a large library base of the <b>Python</b>.<br /><br />
