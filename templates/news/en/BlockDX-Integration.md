# Feb 2020 (Quick) Progress Update

We just wanted to put out a quick update regarding where the project is at. 
 
* Currently The pre alpha stage of dVPN testing is going great. During the development phase we have discovered several possible alternative multi-tiered multi-hop dVPN configurations that could significantly improve the original concept and are being tested and assessed for integration into the first release.
* Service subscription and discovery has been implemented. Along with new Veles masternode framework, Service Manager, and masternode installation scripts.

### Events coming soon

* New Exchange Listing with VLS integration into Block DX decentralized exchange.:grinning: 
* Release of installation script for dVPN & MN for live activation of dVPN for public use with Tier II masternode implementation.
* PrivateSend activation
* Release of native Mobile wallet app

### Later on this year we will be looking towards

* VelesOS live operating system with full integration with Veles privacy services
* Development of infrastructure for a fair decentralized way of governance in preparation for a full community takeover in the years to come.
