# New Wiki and Website Update

Today we have released new Veles Website upgrade featuring new Wiki platform and full mobile support.

As the project have been gradually growing it has reached the point when the information on the website
wasn't properly reflecting project's current stage. The need for a knowledge base with tutorials on
how to set-up and use services and various protocols supported by Veles Network was growing as well,
therefore since the beginning of 2020 we have been also working on the new website upgrade including
powerful single-page Wiki platform built from scratch.

We hope this will help people to access more up-to-date information about the project and to
better benefit from available services thanks to the new tutorials and guides. The News system
implementation will also help us to keep you better updated about new progress, and the Wiki
will continue to grow and accumulate knowledge useful to the project.

### New Major Improvements

 - [custom Wiki platform](/Wiki-Home.wiki.en.html) with already over 25 new articles and tutorials
 - blazing-fast search accross the wiki articles, news and all the website pages
 - News category to make it easy to browse news and share them on other platforms by perma-links
 - full mobile support for all the website
 - new menu structure, updated homepage and lots of small UI/UX improvements and fixes
