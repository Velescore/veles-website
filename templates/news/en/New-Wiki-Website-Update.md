# New Wiki and Website Update

Veles Core is being integrated with Block DX  - The_Blocknet, the fully decentralized exchange, so to trade $VLS you won't have to trust 3rd party exchanges anymore!

Block DX is the first true decentralized exchange that enables trading freedom for connected blockchains, utilizing cross-chain atomic swaps powered by the Blocknet Protocol. Trading occurs directly from your own wallets and your funds remain in your control throughout the entire trade process. This means there's no third-party control over your funds, no need to transfer funds to another account, no waiting for deposit or withdrawal confirmations, and no withdrawal limits.
